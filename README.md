###### 5/18/2018
This project is the result of our Computer Science Capstone. We implemented a mobile messaging application that features multiple chatbots. While the chatbots were pre-trained using personal messaging data, the messaging interface was implemented with the use of websockets that connect the mobile frontend with a Django backend.


The different components are organized into folders:

* Android
  - Frontend code is located in `Android/app/src/main/java/com/example/naveedshah/mimicme3`
* Backend
* ChatModel
* iOS
  - Frontend code is located in `iOS/MimicMe/MimicMe`


#### **Platforms and Languages**
This application runs on two mobile platforms: iOS and Android. The languages used include Python, Java, and Swift. Python is a common language used to implement machine learning algorithms and models and includes many suitable libraries with documentation to support our conversational model. Java and Swift are the respective languages used to implement applications for the Android and iOS mobile environments.
