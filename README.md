###### 2/21/2018

We are living in a time when most people prefer to communicate by way of messages as opposed to any other medium. This preference emerges with the abundance of messaging applications and a plethora of other smartphone capabilities. Due to these conditions many people find it hard to separate themselves from their smartphone devices, even at the risk of their own safety in certain cases.

#### **Vision**
Imagine a person having the ability to set their phone and messaging applications on autopilot. The autopilot feature would be able to handle simple messages received with personalized nuances that fit the person’s “profile”. This capability can be applied to all messaging applications and platforms on the person’s device, such as phone calls, emails, social media, etc. Such an advanced personal assistant would allow users to detach themselves from the constant distractions of mobile devices and focus on what matters to them. Likewise, other parties that are sending messages to the device would benefit from the immediate response and never feel as if they are being ignored or left waiting, and better yet, they would not perceive the difference.

#### **Strategy**
To achieve a step towards this ideal of such an advanced personal assistant, or autopilot capability, we propose to create a standalone chatbot that is trained on a user’s messaging history. The chatbot would be an intelligent agent that is capable of facilitating natural conversation through a messaging interface. Training the agent’s computational model on a user’s messaging history would allow the agent to mimic the user’s verbal patterns and hopefully create messages that resemble that of the user.

#### **Goals**
The goals of this endeavor are twofold: 1) to achieve a computational model that outputs text responses that are indistinguishable from those of the user; 2) to craft a mobile application of this computational model and enabled to run on popular mobile platforms.

#### **Features**
To achieve the mentioned goals, several features must be developed. The chatbot features include:
- access to various messaging apps
- ability to create and send messages
- ability to learn the user’s messaging habits
- ability to auto-respond to user’s messages

In terms of the user, security features must be developed to secure user profiles and accounts; users should be able to interact with the chatbot; and the application should be able to run on both Android and iOS mobile platforms. Lastly, the chatbot user interface should be customizable so that users can configure settings to fit their preferences.

#### **Stories**
**As a *user*, I want:**
- to register to create a new account, so that my data can be stored for later retrieval. 
- to login to retrieve my personal account, so that I can be sure my data is secure.
- my conversations to be encrypted, so that messages cannot be read by unintended receivers.
- a chat window, so that text conversations can take place in real time.
- to access my profile, so that I can configure the settings and modify my user experience to fit my preferences.
- to rate my chatbots responses, so the chatbot improves performance based on my feedback.
- an interface to upload my chat data from various platforms, so that the chatbot can train on more data.


#### **Platforms and Languages**
The proposed application will natively run on two mobile platforms: iOS and Android. The languages used to implement the proposed idea include Python, Java, and Swift. Python is very common language used to implement machine learning algorithms and includes many suitable libraries and documentation to support our conversational model. Java and Swift are the respective languages used to implement applications for the Android and iOS mobile environments.

#### **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
Our proposed MVP is a configurable chatbot application that is capable of running on both Android and iOS platforms. The chatbot will be able to simulate coherent conversation by way of text messages.
